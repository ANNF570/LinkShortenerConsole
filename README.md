# LinkShortenerConsole
This Java program is a URL shortener. It converts long URLs into shorter ones using Base62 encoding and maintains mappings between short and long URLs with two HashMaps. Users can shorten URLs, expand short URLs to their original forms, or exit the application via a command-line interface.
